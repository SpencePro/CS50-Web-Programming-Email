# CS50 Web Programming - Mail

### Description

This is a simple email app created using Django and JavaScript. The part that I was responsible for is the JavaScript, HTML, and 
CSS; the Django was created for me by the course instructor. It was done as an assignment for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming with 
Python and JavaScript online course. The goal was to create a 'single page' email app wherein the display would change with JS. 

### Functionality

Users are able to create an account, send emails to others, respond to emails from others, archive emails, view all the emails they 
have received, view the emails they sent, and view the emails they have archived.
